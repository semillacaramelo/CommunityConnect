# Connectivity Improvements to Deriv Trading Bot

## Summary of Changes
This document outlines the improvements made to address connectivity issues in the Deriv Trading Bot.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Frequent WebSocket disconnections** - The bot was disconnecting approximately every 30 seconds
2. **Incorrect ping response handling** - The bot was triggering unnecessary reconnections due to misinterpreting valid ping responses
3. **Inefficient reconnection strategy** - The reconnection logic was too aggressive, creating a cascade of connection attempts
4. **Non-English comments and logs** - Some code contained Spanish comments and log messages, hindering maintainability
5. **Suboptimal caching** - The data fetcher lacked proper cache management

## Implemented Solutions

### In `deriv_connector.py`:
1. **Improved WebSocket configuration**
   - Modified ping intervals from 10s to managed custom interval of 30s
   - Disabled built-in ping timeouts to handle them manually
   - Added proper heartbeat task management

2. **Enhanced ping/pong handling**
   - Fixed validation of ping responses to correctly identify Deriv API formats
   - Added more robust response parsing to prevent unnecessary reconnections
   - Improved timeout error handling

3. **Optimized reconnection strategy**
   - Increased waiting periods between reconnection attempts
   - Added proper cleanup of resources when closing connections
   - Implemented better state tracking for connection status

4. **Improved error handling**
   - Enhanced logging for connection events
   - Added more context to error messages
   - Implemented better recovery from unexpected responses

### In `data_fetcher.py`:
1. **Translated all Spanish comments and log messages to English**
   - Converted all variable names, comments, and logs to English for consistency
   - Fixed inconsistent language usage throughout the file

2. **Enhanced caching mechanisms**
   - Added cache expiry controls
   - Implemented memory-aware cache optimization
   - Added utilities to monitor and manage the cache

3. **Improved data fetching efficiency**
   - Better integration with the improved connector
   - Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
   - More robust error handling

4. **Added new utility methods**
   - `get_cache_info()` to monitor cache status
   - `optimize_cache()` to manage memory usage
   - Better validation before cache access

### In `main.py`:
- Fixed remaining Spanish comments in the trading loop

## Benefits
1. **Increased Stability** - Significantly reduced disconnections and connection errors
2. **Improved Efficiency** - Better caching reduces unnecessary API calls
3. **Enhanced Maintainability** - Consistent English documentation and logging
4. **Better Error Recovery** - More robust handling of network and API issues
5. **Reduced Resource Usage** - Optimized cache management prevents memory bloat

## Testing
The improvements have been tested using:
1. Extended connectivity tests with `test_api_connectivity.py --extended`
2. Demo mode trading operation for extended periods
3. Connection verification with `--check-connection` flag

All tests have shown significant improvement in connectivity stability and error handling.
